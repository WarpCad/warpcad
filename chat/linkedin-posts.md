## [2026-09-05T16:20:34Z] — Kickoff commit: third CAD attempt + geometry kernel decision

**Post:** Starting a third build of a browser-based parametric CAD app, and this kickoff commit leads with two retrospectives instead of a feature list.

The first attempt built well-tested components that never got assembled into a working app. The second fixed that, then shipped a version where every automated test passed and a real user still couldn't get sketch mode to open — a concrete lesson in the gap between "the code does what its own test asserts" and "a human can actually drive it."

This kickoff writes both lessons directly into the process docs: a fixed set of human-driven acceptance scenarios instead of an ever-growing manual checklist, per-task reachability gates, and JSCAD V3 as the geometry kernel — chosen for direct continuity with three existing hand-maintained libraries rather than on raw technical merits alone.

Built with Claude Code, reviewed by me.

**Evidence:** This is the repo's first commit → `git log` this session ("does not have any commits yet"); sketch mode / passing-tests-but-broken-app failure → `SECOND-ATTEMPT.md` (diff); JSCAD V3 chosen for continuity with existing libraries → `docs/decisions/geometry-kernel.md` (diff)
